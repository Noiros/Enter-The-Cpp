# 🔫 Enter the CPP (Enter the Gungeon like) - C++ & SDL2
This project is a prototype to reproduce the game "Enter the Gungeon", developed for fun in C++ with the SDL2 lib. It was coded in a few weeks on the side to quickly replicate the basic gameplay of the original game.

## 🚀 Current Features
Character Movement: Use the arrow keys (or ZQSD) to move around the dungeon.
Shooting: Press space to shoot and eliminate enemies.
Dungeon Generation: A new room layout is generated at each launch, ensuring infinite replayability.
Basic Enemies: Fight a few simple enemy types.
